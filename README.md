# SrtFixer
In some cases, some subtitles files are kinda corrupt, time signature is the same in different nodes. This program aims to fix this bug the fastest way possible. (This has been my first program so pls do not bully me)
For this to work the srt must be corrupt, if not, no changes will occur. An example of this working would be.
At the moment it does only work with UTF-8

python3 ivan.py FileIn FileOut

The output will be a file with the name you wrote in FileOut (need to put .srt in here for it to work)
